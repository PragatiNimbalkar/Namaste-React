1 What is Emmet?
Ans--> Basically Emmet is used to write HTML and CSS faster
Emmet is actually built in VS code
we can say it is web-development toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML and CSS workFlow.
it is abbrevation and snippet tool that allow us to write shotcuts ,which are then expanded out into a complete section of code.

    a) How to enable emmet in VSCode
        1) goto left bottom corner setting icon and then click on that
        2) then select settings option from the list click on that2
        3) then you will get one window ,over there click on Open setting(Json) icon ,which is present on right tom corner
        4) once click on that icon you will open settings.json file open
        5) so there we need to add below code 
        "emmet.includeLanguages": {
                "javascrip": "javascriptreact"
            }

example if we write h1.myclass and put tab it will auto complete below line of code
        <h1class="myclass"></h1>

2 Difference between a Library and Framework
Ans--> The Technical difference between Library and Framework lies in a term called Inversion Of Control
 -when you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application, You are choosing when and where to use library.
 -when you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provided some places for you to plugin your code, but it called the code plugged in as needed 
 -example --> JQuery is libraby and Vue.js is a framework
 -Frameworks and libraries are both code written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way.
 -A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A library doesn’t. The programmer calls the -library where and when they need it.
 -The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer will dictate how “opinionated” it is.

 3 What is CDN? Why do we use it?
 Ans --> CDN or Content Delivery Network has been around since the late 90's
 --It was Originally developed to speed up the delivery of Static HTML Content for users all around the world.
 --CDN had evolved over the ensuring decades.
 --NOwadays, a CDN should be used whenever HTTP trafic is served.

 Why do we use it--> 
 --The number one reason for using CDN is to improve your user's experience in terms of speed
 --A website may be hosted in a particular region, but if the majority of its users are coming from an entirely different region – eg., --if your site is hosted in North America, GTmetrix might report fast speeds based on our default test location, but if a good chunk --of your users come from Europe, their speed will not be as fast as you experience it to be.
 
 --A global CDN would allow users from a European point of origin to download static content from a closer source. Instead of spanning --the Atlantic ocean to retrieve data, they can connect to a server in say, London, UK, to get the same data. This reduces latency and --provides a faster loading of your website.

 --CDNs not only ensure a faster experience to your users, but they also help to prevent site crashes in the event of traffic surges – --CDNs help to distribute bandwidth across multiple servers, instead of allowing one server to handle all traffic.

4 Why is React known as React?
Ans --> React is called as react because it was designed to be a declarative, efficient and flexible javascript library for building 
user interfaces.
--The name "React" was choose because the library was designed to allow developers to "react" to changes in state and data within an
 application, and to update user interface in a declarative and efficient manner.
-- React was developed by facebook and released in 2013 ,and it has since become javascript one of the most popular libraries 
for building web and mobile applications.
-- It is used by many companies and organizations around the world, and it has a large and active developer community.

5 What is crossorigin in script tag?
Ans  ==> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
The HTML <script> crossorigin Attribute is used for loading an external script into their domain from a third party server or another domain with the support of HTTP CORS Request. This attribute is used to protect sensitive information from the third party when fetching out the results.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing(CORS) is a tool that allows web pages requesting for resources from another domain that is outside of their own domain. It is also used for managing cross-origin requests which is a request for a resource from an outside domain.

Syntax:

<script crossorigin="anonymous | use-credentials">

Attribute Values:

anonymous: It has a default value. It defines a CORS request will be sent without passing the credentials information.
use-credentials: A cross-origin request will be sent with credentials, cookies, and certificate.
Note: This attribute is only valid for use if we try to fetch the resources from the third party domain. 

Example: Below code illustrates the use of crossorigin attribute with the <script> element. 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 
<head>
    <title>HTML script crossorigin Attribute</title>
</head>
 
<body style="text-align: center">
    <h1>GeeksForGeeks</h1>
 
    <h2>HTML script crossorigin Attribute</h2>
 
    <br />
    <button>Submit</button>
 
    <script type="text/javascript"
        src="my_script.js" crossorigin="anonymous">
    </script>
</body>
 
</html>

6 What is diference between React and ReactDOM
Ans ==> When you work with React, it is more than likely that you will build your apps with JSX. The JSX is a tag-based JavaScript syntax like looks familiar with HTML. React element is the atomic and most basic unit that you need to master before JSX and before moving forward with React.

Note: In order to work with React in the browsers, we need to include 2 libraries: React and ReactDOM. React library is responsible for creating views and ReactDOM library is responsible to actually render UI in the browser.

Including Scripts: Following are the CDN links for React and ReactDOM:

React: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react
ReactDOM: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react-dom

7 What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
Ans ==> 
The development build is used - as the name suggests - for development reasons. You have Source Maps, debugging and often times hot reloading ability in those builds.

The production build, on the other hand, runs in production mode which means this is the code running on your client's machine.

8 What is async and defer?
Ans ==>If async is present: The script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed as soon as it is available (before parsing completes)
 If defer is present (and not async ): The script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing.

9 What is shortest program of JavaScript?
Ans  ==> An Empty File

10 What is shortest program of React?
Ans ==>Injecting React Into The Code
 <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
